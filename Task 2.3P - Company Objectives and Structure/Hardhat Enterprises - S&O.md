Our overall goal is to find different vulnerabilities in the protocols and systems used for space communications and to ultimately document successful exploitations, the methodologies behind them, and potential remedies.

#### Aims for Trimester


- Improve current documentation & testing enviroments:
   - Improve the current state of training documentation.
   - Improve the current start of the testing enviroment.
   - Migrate all the the training and required upskills documents to Github.
