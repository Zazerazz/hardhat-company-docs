## Company Structure and Projects Overview
This trimester (T3/2022), the company is working on five different projects, each supporting the goals of the company in a different way.  

### Breaking CAPTCHA
#### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

The goal of the Breaking CAPTCHA project is to develop machine learning, AI, and computer vision models to autonomously solve CAPTCHA problems. The final product of the project will be to provide end users with an interface to solve these CAPTCHA problems. This user interface will be the focus of future iterations. The Hardhat Director wants a product that improves upon current open-source solutions for this problem. As a result, the models to be produced will need to be either more accurate, reliable, or solve a novel issue facing current CAPTCHA solving models. This will be done through several steps, including research and development, creating of models, and deployment of models as well as engineering of deployment and model pipelines. This will be supported by cloud infrastructure developed to solve storage, processing, DevOps and handover issues allowing for the production of ‘infrastructure as code’ artefacts.  

#### Aims for Trimester

The project aims for this trimester are to leverage the learnings of previous work as well as the current capability of the team. Our trimester deliverables will be: •

- Infrastructure as code product to enable efficient handover of cloud infrastructure. 
- Improving the performance of the Machine learning model that breaks Audio CAPTCHAs.
- Developing novel methods for solving Audio CAPTCHAS
- Progressing the development of a non-segmentation model that will break text CAPTCHAs.
- An Improved pipeline which connects R&D and UI deliverables through Machine Learning pipelines, CI/CD pipelines and improved infrastructure.
- Improving the showcase website in both usability and runtime.

#### Deliverables

Trimester Deliverables

- Text and Audio CAPTCHA breaking black box models which are versioned and operationalised
- Improved performance of CAPTCHA breaking models
- Improved runtime of Cloud based solutions
- Connectivity between R&D and Products using Cloud resources as well as CI/CD and ML pipelines
- Improved Documentation of progress to date
- Improved analysis of state of the art of the Breaking CAPTCHA
- Possibly research and proof of concept solutions for cognitive reasoning based CAPTCHAS

Long Term Deliverables

- An end user product that will allow a user to solve CAPTCHA in real-time with minimal human input 
  - App or website
  - Chrome Extension

### App Attack
#### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

Deakin's OnTrack online application will undergo secure code review and web application penetration testing from AppAttack. The objective is to deliver a comprehensive security report to Deakin that includes the identification of vulnerabilities and recommendations for application and code hardening.

The AppAttack project for this trimester will begin from scratch. Except for retesting prior findings, earlier iterations and deliverables won't be carried over into this trimester.

Additionally, the goal of AppAttack is to provide internal deliverables to support subsequent rounds of AppAttack and deliverables of value to our customer Deakin. Internal deliverables aim to develop a methodology, frameworks, report templates, a centralized knowledge base, and exploitation tools to speed up client deliverables and increase the range of services and products offered by AppAttack.

#### Aims for Trimester

- Build a testing environment 
- Improving our testing environments
  - Each subteam will dive deep into one particular part of OnTrack (like authentication, APIs) 
  - Provides instructions on replicating the updated environment.
  - Allow the next trimester can do the work continuously and not restart.
- Perform penetration testing on OnTracks in an attempt to find working exploits for vulnerability
  - Both successful and unsuccessful exploits should be recorded and discussed, including the
process of trial and error that was used to reach a working exploit
- Provide analysis for OnTrack codebase's security
  - Provide recommendation for both vulnerable and potential dangerous
- Develop procedures, templates, and techniques.
- Create an experience that is comparable to the industry for students to emphasise on resumes when applying for high-caliber professions.
- Add value for stakeholders, clients, and students.
- Offer Deakin University deliverables that are worthwhile.

#### Deliverables

- Deliver a Web Application Penetration Testing Report and Secure Code Review to Deakin University meet the industry standard.
- Cover all parts of OnTrack's codebase

### NASA Exploits Project
#### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

The NASA Protocol Exploits project consists of a team of students that aim to evaluate and investigate the current implementation of the Interplanetary Overlay Network (ION) environment provided by the NASA JPL team. The motivation behind this project stems from the sensitive nature of data communicated over satellites, which typically have ‘security’ low on the priority list. Our overall goal is to analyze the source code and environment to identify various vulnerabilities in the protocols and systems used for space communications and to ultimately document successful exploitations, the methodologies behind them, and potential remedies.

#### Aims for Trimester
The NASA Protocol Exploits team aims to advance the project in three different areas over T3 of 2022. The three areas the project seeks to improve are as follows;   

**Static Code Analysis** - The static analysis team, given the nature of work, carried out in previous trimesters and the list of vulnerabilities generated via automated vulnerability/defect services such as Coverity. The group aims to work through the highest-priority vulnerabilities and document their findings alongside reviewing several aspects of the environment's source code. Some tasks include but are not limited to:
  * Reporting on the validity of previously detected vulnerabilities.
  * Reporting the potential impact of such vulnerabilities.
  * Providing potential remidies and/or code fixes.
  * Developing and deploying exploits from said vulnerabilities.  
  
**Dynamic Code Analysis** - The dynamic analysis team aims to continue developing and deploying various fuzzing tools/techniques from the last trimester. The goal is to attack the testing environment to see multiple protocols within the DTN stack react and report on the findings. Some tasks include but are not limited to:
  * Developing various fuzzing tools using python libraries.
  * Developing various attack scenarios.
  * Reporting on the techniques used and experiment findings.

**Improve Company Documentation / Environment** - All project members aim to improve the overall quality of training materials, and the current way documentation is kept with the end goal of migrating resources to GitHub. Some tasks include but are not limited to: 
 * Contributing to the NASA Exploits Project GitHub.
 * Converting older resources in SharePoint to markdown for better source control.
 * Improving the current state of training material / junior onboarding process. 
 * Improving the current state of the testing environment.

#### Deliverables
Trimester deliverables for the following teams:  
  1. Static Analysis Team: 
     - Vulnerability Reports and Findings
     - Exploits?!
  2. Dynamic Analysis Team:
     - Fuzzing Scripts for the following protocols; CFDP, AOS, BP, and LTP.
     - Vulnerability Reports.
     - Experiment Finding Reports.
     - Attack Scenarios.
  3. Project Leadership / Contributing Members:
     - Company Handbook on GitHub.
     - Updated Training Resources.
     - Various Frameworks for vulnerability identification and Reporting
   
Long-Term Deliverables for the project: 
  1. Successful exploitation of the protocol, potential real-world satellite interception.
  2. Write/Submit a script to automatically exploit the protocol or intercept satellite communications.
  3. Create a resource pool for the future extensibility of the project.
  4. Present research findings and remediation recommendations to NASA.
  5. Attain access to the full version of ION.
