## Company Structure and Projects Overview
This trimester (T3/2022), the company is working on five different projects, each supporting the goals of the company in a different way.  

### Breaking CAPTCHA
#### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

The goal of the Breaking CAPTCHA project is to develop machine learning, AI, and computer vision models to autonomously solve CAPTCHA problems. The final product of the project will be to provide end users with an interface to solve these CAPTCHA problems. This user interface will be the focus of future iterations.The Hardhat Director wants a product that improves upon current open-source solutions for this problem. As a result, the models to be produced will need to be either more accurate, reliable, or solvea novel issue facing current CAPTCHA solving models. This will be done through several steps, including research and development, creating of models, and deployment of models. This will be supported by cloud infrastructure developed to solve storage, processing, DevOps and handover issues allowing for the production of ‘infrastructure as code’ artefacts.  

#### Aims for Trimester

The project aims for this trimester are to leverage the learnings of previous work as well as the current capability of the team. Our trimester deliverables will be: •Infrastructure as code product to enable efficient handover of cloud infrastructure. 

- Improving the performance of the Machine learning model that breaks Audio CAPTCHAs.
- Developing novel methods for solving Audio CAPTCHAS
- Progressing the development of a nonsegmentation model that will break text CAPTCHAs.
- Progress development Image CAPTCHA models.
- An Improved pipeline which connects R&D and UI deliverables through CI/CD and improved infrastructure.
- Improving the showcase website in both usability and runtime.

#### Deliverables

Trimester Deliverables

- Text, Image and Audio CAPTCHA breaking black box models which are versioned
- Improved performance of CAPTCHA breaking models
- Improved runtime of Cloud based solutions
- Connectivity between R&D and Products using Cloud resources as well as CI/CD pipelines
- Improved Documentation of progress to date
- Improved analysis of state of the art of the Breaking CAPTCHA

Long Term Deliverables

- An end user product that will allow a user to solve CAPTCHA in real-time with minimal human input 
  - App or website
  - Chrome Extension

### NASA Exploits Project
#### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

NASA Protocol Exploits consists of a team that aims to evaluate security implementation in space communications. The motivation for this project is the sensitive nature of data that is communicated over satellites, which typically have ‘security’ low on the priority list. Our overall goal is to find different vulnerabilities in the protocols and systems used for space communications and to ultimately document successful exploitations, the methodologies behind them, and potential remedies.

#### Aims for Trimester


- Improve current documentation & testing enviroments:
   - Improve the current state of training documentation.
   - Improve the current start of the testing enviroment.
   - Migrate all the the training and required upskills documents to Github.  
 - Begin Static Code analysis:
   - Details on the deliverables.
   - More details on the deliverables.
 - Continue Dynamic Code analysis:
   - Details on the deliverables.
   - More details on the deliverables.
