## Company Structure and Projects Overview
### General Overview
This trimester (T3/2022), the company is working on four different projects, each supporting the company's goals in another way. Unfortunately, given the limited number of members this trimester, our fifth project, the Penetration testing GUI has been suspended until further notice.  

### Project Relationships
NASA Protocol Exploits, App Attack, and Fortify all directly contribute to the goals of the company.
Apart from the contribution to the goals of the company: 
- Penetration Testing GUI will also act as a tool that can potentially support the goals and objecting of the NASA protocol exploits project, AppAttack, and Fortify Projects. 
-	Breaking CAPTCHA could also provide an attack method that would be integrated into the PT GUI software as an additional capability.

### Breaking CAPTCHA
#### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

The goal of the Breaking CAPTCHA project is to develop machine learning, AI, and computer vision models to autonomously solve CAPTCHA problems. The final product of the project will be to provide end users with an interface to solve these CAPTCHA problems. This user interface will be the focus of future iterations. The Hardhat Director wants a product that improves upon current open-source solutions for this problem. As a result, the models to be produced will need to be either more accurate, reliable, or solve a novel issue facing current CAPTCHA solving models. This will be done through several steps, including research and development, creating of models, and deployment of models, as well as engineering of deployment and model pipelines. This will be supported by cloud infrastructure developed to solve storage, processing, DevOps, and handover issues allowing for the production of ‘infrastructure as code’ artifacts.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### App Attack
#### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

Deakin's OnTrack online application will undergo secure code review and web application penetration testing from AppAttack. The objective is to deliver a comprehensive security report to Deakin that includes the identification of vulnerabilities and recommendations for application and code hardening.

The AppAttack project for this trimester will begin from scratch. Except for retesting prior findings, earlier iterations and deliverables won't be carried over into this trimester.

Additionally, the goal of AppAttack is to provide internal deliverables to support subsequent rounds of AppAttack and deliverables of value to our customer Deakin. Internal deliverables aim to develop a methodology, frameworks, report templates, a centralized knowledge base, and exploitation tools to speed up client deliverables and increase the range of services and products offered by AppAttack.

#### Aims for Trimester

- Build a testing environment 
- Improving our testing environments
  - Each subteam will dive deep into one particular part of OnTrack (like authentication, APIs) 
  - Provides instructions on replicating the updated environment.
  - Allow the next trimester can do the work continuously and not restart.
- Perform penetration testing on OnTracks in an attempt to find working exploits for the vulnerability
  - Both successful and unsuccessful exploits should be recorded and discussed, including the
process of trial and error that was used to reach a working exploit
- Provide analysis for OnTrack codebase's security provider recommendations for both vulnerable and potentially dangerous
- Develop procedures, templates, and techniques.
- Create an experience that is comparable to the industry for students to emphasize resumes when applying for high-caliber professions.
- Add value for stakeholders, clients, and students.
- Offer Deakin University deliverables that are worthwhile.

#### Deliverables

- Deliver a Web Application Penetration Testing Report and Secure Code Review to Deakin University to meet the industry standard.
